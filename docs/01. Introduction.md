## What is ZfcDatagrid?

[ZfcDatagrid](https://github.com/ThaDafinser/ZfcDatagrid/) is a datagrid or datatable module for 
[Zend Framework](https://github.com/zendframework/zendframework/), it can handle multiple data sources like 
[Doctrine2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/), 
Zend\Db and PHP Array, and may output to multiple formats also like [jqGrid](http://jqgrid.com/), 
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),  CLI, PDF and Excel... and others.
