# Getting started guide

## What is ZfcDatagrid and what is it not?
First i want to clarify that ZfcDatagrid is **NOT a CRUD abstraction**, 
it's here to **read data from different sources and display it in different output formats (HTML, PDF, Excel, ...)**.

## Installation
If ZfcDatagrid is not installed already, please continue reading here https://github.com/ThaDafinser/ZfcDatagrid#installation

> If you want to use the **Date Range Picker** on bootstrapTable, please include the JS/CSS files from https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker 

> If you want to use the **JqGrid**, please include the JS/CSS files on your own (it's not part of ZfcDatagrid)

## Your first datagrid
The first datagrid is a really simple one, to see if everything works for you. 
It'll work if you have ZF2-Skeleton installed or Twitter Bootstrap included out of the box.

You find this example here https://github.com/ThaDafinser/ZfcDatagrid/blob/master/docs/Grid-minimal.md

After you have copied it into your module, make sure the controller is registered and the routing works.

Now you can try to call this action (with your defined route) and you should see your first ZfcDatagrid! (Congratulations)
It's renderer with the output mode "bootstrapTable", where you can already paginate, filter and sort your data

## What to do now
> Continue with the provided [code examples](https://github.com/ThaDafinser/ZfcDatagrid/blob/master/src/ZfcDatagrid/Examples/Controller/) or read further in the [documentation](https://github.com/ThaDafinser/ZfcDatagrid/blob/master/docs/)
