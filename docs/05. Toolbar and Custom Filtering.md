# Toolbar and Custom Filtering

In this part, we will learn the following:

* Introduction
* Global Actions
* Custom Filtering (Middle Toolbar Template)
* Export Links
* Use Custome Toolbar

## Introduction

In the ZfcDatagrid, there is an area above the grid table that is used for many purposes,
mainly there are 3 areas above the grid table, one for Global Actions, the middle for custom
toolbars or cutome filtering area, and the last one for export links. Details for each one 
are explained bellow.

## Global Actions

You can add global actions to the grid, which is an array of a `$name => $url` structure,
the grid will display these links above the grid table, bellow is an example on how to use
the global actions:

You can set the global actions for once like the following:
```php
$globalActions = array (
    'Add New' => 'url/of/add',
    'Go Back' => 'url/of/back/link'
);
$grid->setGlobalAction($globalActions);
```

Or you can add one global action everytime you want as the following:
```php
$grid->addGlobalAction('Add New', 'url/of/add');
$grid->addGlobalAction('Go Back', 'url/of/back/link');
```

## Custom Filtering (Middle Toolbar Template)

In the middle area you can add any view template you want which will be rendered using the
Zend Framework 2 `partial` view helper. 

For example you can add a custom form in a view template and view it in this middle area, but
notice that you will be responsible to get the variables from the form in the controller
action and handle the filtering of the Datasource of the Grid.

To set a view template in the toolbar middle area you can do the following:
```php
$grid->setMiddleToolbarTemplate('my-path/to/view-template');
```

## Export Links

For the last area, the export links will be displayed in it, for example the export to `Excel`
and export to `PDF` will be displayed in it.

## Use Custome Toolbar

You can also use your own toolbar to be displayed above the grid table, and you can set the
custom toolbar using the following method:
```php
$grid->setToolbarTemplate('my-path/awesome-list/grid-toolbar');
```
