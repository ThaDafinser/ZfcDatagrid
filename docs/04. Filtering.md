# Filtering

Every grid comes per default with a column filtering. 
Dependend of the entered filtering values, the operator for the filtering will change.

The default operator is LIKE with wildcards on both sides...
To change the default operator, you can set it for each column explicit:
```php
$column->setFilterDefaultOperation(\ZfcDatagrid\Filter::YOUR_TYPE);
```

or you set the appropriate Column\Type. For example the Type\Number has the default operator "EQUAL".
```php
use ZfcDatagrid\Column\Type;
$column->setType(new Type\Number());
```

If you are using a bootstrapTable and you want a daterange picker as filter on your column remember to enable it on the config file and in every column where you want it
```php
use ZfcDatagrid\Column\Type;
$dateType = new Type\DateTime();
$dateType->setDaterangePickerEnabled();
$column->setType($dateType);
```

## Currently available filters
> Note: the entered filter is trimmed automatically (left/right and between the operator/value)
